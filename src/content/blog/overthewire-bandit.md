There's honestly not much to explain about this wargame. OverTheWire is simply awesome! I really enjoyed the challenges, and it's such a great resource for anyone who's learning.

I'll just leave a quick recap of what I have learned from playing through this. 🙌

## Level 0

Level Goal

>The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is **bandit.labs.overthewire.org**, on port 2220. The username is **bandit0** and the password is **bandit0**. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

The first level is super easy. We need to **SSH** into Bandit with username `bandit0` and password `bandit0` on port **2220**.

![bandit0-login](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit0-login.png)

We successfully login into Bandit:

![bandit0-success-login](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit0-success-login.png)

You'll see a welcome message with some notes:

![note](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit0-note.png)

>**bandit0**

## Level 0 &rarr; Level 1

Level Goal 

>The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

The password for the next level is stored in **readme** file in the home directory. We just need to use **cat** to read its content.

![level1-pass](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit1-pass.png)

>**ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If**

## Level 1 &rarr; Level 2

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in a file called **-** located in the home directory

File named `-` stores the password. Since this is a special filename, we must use **./** to read it.

![level-2-pass](public/image/overthewire-bandit/level-2-pass.png)

>**263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx**

## Level 2 &rarr; Level 3

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in a file called **spaces in this filename** located in the home directory

Since the file name we need to read **has spaces**, we must place it inside **quotes**.

![level-3-pass](public/image/overthewire-bandit/level-3-pass.png)

>**MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx**

## Level 3 &rarr; Level 4

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.

To get into **inhere** directory, we use `cd`. When we get there, the password is stored in **a hidden file**, so we must use `ls -la` to see it. Now our job is to read the password.

![bandit3-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit3-solution.png)

>**2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ**

## Level 4 &rarr; Level 5

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the **inhere** directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

The password is in a **human-readable file** in the **inhere** directory. To get the property of the file, we use the command `file`.

![bandit4-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit4-solution.png)

> **4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw**

## Level 5 &rarr; Level 6

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the **inhere** directory and has all of the following properties:<br>
&ensp;&ensp;human-readable<br>
&ensp;&ensp;1033 bytes in size<br>
&ensp;&ensp;not executable

In **inhere**, we have other folders.

![inhere-folder-bandit5](public/image/overthewire-bandit/inhere-folder-bandit5.png)

We can find the file we want by using flags in `find`.

![bandit5-find](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit5-find.png)

Read that file and we have the password.

![bandit5-pass](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit5-pass.png)

>**HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG**

## Level 6 &rarr; Level 7

Level Goal 

>The password for the next level is stored **somewhere on the server** and has all of the following properties:<br>
&ensp;&ensp;owned by user bandit7<br>
&ensp;&ensp;owned by group bandit6<br>
&ensp;&ensp;33 bytes in size

Just like the previous level, we can use the `find` command with some flags to locate the target file. The phrase **"somewhere on the server"** hints that we might need to search from the root directory `/`.

![bandit6-version1](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit6-version1.png)

Oh, we get lots of **errors** printed to **stdout**. To clean things up, we can redirect **stderr** to `/dev/null`.

![bandit6-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit6-solution.png)

>**morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj**

## Level 7 &rarr; Level 8

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**

In this level, we use `grep` to filter things in file better.

![bandit7-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit7-solution.png)

>**dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc**

## Level 8 &rarr; Level 9

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** and is the only line of text that occurs only once

In this level, we use `uniq` to find the occurence of line. Since `uniq` only **filters adjacent matching lines**, we first need to use the `sort` command.

![bandit8-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit8-solution.png)

>**4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM**

## Level 9 &rarr; Level 10

Level Goal 

>The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

Since **data.txt** is not an **ASCII** file, it may contains non-human-readable characters. To get the readable one, we use `strings` command, and filter it by `grep`.

![bandit9-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit9-solution.png)

>**FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey**

## Level 10 &rarr; Level 11

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which contains base64 encoded data

Since the content of **data.txt** contains characters **"=="**, which is used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" target="_blank">base64</a> for padding.

![base64](public/image/overthewire-bandit/base-64-signal.png)

To decrypt the file, we use `base64` with flag `-d`.

![bandit10-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit10-solution.png)

>**dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr**

## Level 11 &rarr; Level 12

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

The password is in a file, but it's encrypted with **rot13**.

![bandit11-overview](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit11-overview.png)

Searching online, here's how to decrypt it.

![rot13-decrypt](public/image/overthewire-bandit/rot13-decrypt.png)

Use `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'` to decrypt:

![bandit11-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit11-solution.png)

>**7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4**

## Level 12 &rarr; Level 13

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

Since **data.txt** is a hexdump, we use `xxd -r` to convert it into binary.

![bandit12-solution-1](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit12-solution-1.png)

Next, we use the `file` command to check the file type and figure out how to decompress it.

![bandit-12-solution-2](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit12-solution-2.png)

![bandit-12-solution-3](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit12-solution-3.png)

Finally, we find the password file :v

![bandit12-solution-4](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit12-solution-4.png)

>**FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn**

## Level 13 &rarr; Level 14

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14**. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note: localhost** is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

As user **bandit13**, we're given a private SSH key to log in as **bandit14**. Use `ssh -i` to log in with that key

![bandit13-ssh](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit13-ssh.png)

Once logged in, just read the password file:

![bandit13-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit13-solution.png)

>**MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS**

## Level 14 &rarr; Level 15

Level Goal

>The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30000 on localhost**.

We use `nc` to connect to **port 30000 on localhost**, then send **bandit14's password**.

![bandit14-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit14-solution.png)

>**8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo**

## Level 15 &rarr; Level 16

Level Goal

>The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30001 on localhost** using SSL/TLS encryption.<br>
**Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.**

To establish **a TCP connection using SSL/TLS encryption**, we use `ncat --ssl`.

![bandit15-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit15-solution.png)

>**kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx**

## Level 16 &rarr; Level 17

Level Goal

>The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.<br>
**Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.**

First, use `nmap` to scan for open ports between **31000 and 32000**:

![bandit16-nmap](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit16-nmap.png)

Then, try connecting to each open port with `ncat --ssl` to see which one gives valid output:

![bandit16-ncat](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit16-ncat.png)

One of the ports returns a private SSH key, use it to log in as **bandit17**:

![bandit16-ssh](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit16-ssh.png)

Finally, read the password:

![bandit16-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit16-solution.png)

>**EReVavePLFHtFlFsjn3hyzMlvSuSAcRD**

## Level 17 &rarr; Level 18

Level Goal

>There are 2 files in the homedirectory: **passwords.old and passwords.new**. The password for the next level is in **passwords.new** and is the only line that has been changed between **passwords.old and passwords.new**<br>
**NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19**

For this level, use `diff` to compare the changes between **passwords.old and passwords.new**.

![bandit17-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit17-solution.png)

> **x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO**

## Level 18 &rarr; Level 19

Level Goal

>The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

As expected, logging into **bandit18** immediately shows "Byebye!" because **.bashrc** logs us out.

![bandit18-byebye](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit18-byebye.png)

To bypass this, use `ssh -t` to force a terminal, and run a clean shell with `bash --norc` to avoid loading **.bashrc**:

![bandit18-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit18-solution.png)

>**cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8**

## Level 19 &rarr; Level 20

Level Goal

>To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

The file `bandit20-do` has the **setuid bit set** and is owned by **bandit20**, meaning we can **run it with bandit20's privileges**.

![bandit20-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit19-solution.png)

>**0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO**

## Level 20 &rarr; Level 21

Level Goal

>There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).<br>
**NOTE:** Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

This level simulates **Client-Server Communication**.

We set up a local **Server** using `nc -l -p <port>` that sends **the bandit20 password** when a Client connects. The setuid binary `./suconnect` acts as the **Client** and connects to our server. If the password is correct, we'll get back the next level's password.

![bandit20-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit20-solution.png)

>**EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt**

## Level 21 &rarr; Level 22

Level Goal

>A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

First, we change directory to **/etc/cron.d/**, and find out there is a file named **cronjob_bandit22**. In this file, it has established a scheduler file **/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh** which runs for every minute with user bandit22 privileges.

![bandit21-cronjob](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit21-cronjob.png)

Let's read that scheduler file.

![bandit21-read-file](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit21-read-file.png)

Looks like the password for user **bandit22** is stored into file **/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv**. Just read that file and we get the password.

![bandit21-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit21-solution.png)

>**tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q**

## Level 22 &rarr; Level 23

Level Goal

>A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.<br>
**NOTE:** Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

Like previous level, there's a scheduler file, **/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh**, which runs for every minute with user bandit23 privileges.

However, the file that stored the password for the next level is calculated based on the **myname** variable, which stores the name of current user, and **mytarget** (password file) is being hashed. In the below picture, we use user **bandit22**, and we get the password file for user bandit22.

![bandit22-testing](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit22-testing.png)

Since that scheduler file is run as user **bandit23** privileges, it will use user **bandit23** as the value of **myname** variable, and **mytarget** will be the hashed password file that we need.

![bandit22-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit22-solution.png)

>**0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga**

## Level 23 &rarr; Level 24

Level Goal

>A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.<br>
>**NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!<br>
>**NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…

Another job scheduler challenge, this time, the scheduler file is **/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh**, running every minute with user bandit24 privileges. 

![bandit23-testing](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit23-testing.png)

The scheduler file simply checks all the files in `/var/spool/bandit24/foo` (including hidden ones). If the file belongs to user **bandit23**, it gets executed (with a 60s timeout) and deleted right after.

To solve this, we create a script in **/tmp** that reads the password into **result.txt**, make it executable, then move it to `/var/spool/bandit24/foo`. Wait a minute, and the cronjob will do the rest!

![bandit23-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit23-solution.png)

>**gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8**

## Level 24 &rarr; Level 25

Level Goal

>A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.<br>
You do not need to create new connections each time

First, let's establish a TCP connection on port 30002 to see what happens.

![bandit24-testing](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit24-testing.png)

We have to enter the password for user **bandit24** and a pincode (4-digit). To get the correct pincode, we could use the bruteforce method!

![bandit24-setup](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit24-setup.png)

Run the script and get the password.

![bandit24-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit24-solution.png)

>**iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4**

## Level 25 &rarr; Level 26

Level Goal

>Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;NOTE: if you’re a Windows user and typically use Powershell to ssh into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt instead.

![bandit25-testing](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit25-testing.png)

We have the private SSH key for **bandit26**, but the shell isn't **/bin/bash**, so login fails.

![bandit25-testing-fail](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit25-testing-fail.png)

To see what shell **bandit26** uses, check `/etc/passwd`:

![bandit25-checking-shell](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit25-checking-shell.png)

Turns out, it runs more `/home/bandit26/text.txt` on login, which shows a banner. But since it's using `more`, we can trigger a trick: shrink the terminal size to overload the buffer, then press `v` to enter `vim`, and use `:e` to read the password file.

![more-command](public/image/overthewire-bandit/more-command.png)

![bandit25-solution1](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit25-solution1.png)

>**s0773xxkk0MXfdqOfPRVr9L3jJBUOgCZ**

## Level 26 &rarr; Level 27

Level Goal

>Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

In this level, we use the trick from previous level, **shrinking the terminal to overflow `more`**, press `v` to enter `vim`, then set the shell to **/bin/bash** and read the password.

![bandit26-solution1](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit26-solution1.png)

Level Goal

>There is a git repository at ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit29-git is the same as for the user bandit29.<br>
Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

In this level, we learn how to use **branches in git**, which allows us to work on different parts of a project independently.

>Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

In this level, we learn about **tag in git**, which will be used to store important information like the password or other confidential data.

![bandit30-solution1](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit30-solution1.png)

![bandit30-solution2](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit30-solution2.png)

Since there is nothing we can exploit in **git log** and **git branch**, we can try to check `tag in git`.

## Level 31 &rarr; Level 32

Level Goal

>There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.<br>
Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

![bandit31-solution1](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit31-solution1.png)

We are asked to **push** file `key.txt` to the repo. If we successfully in that, we can get the password.

![bandit31-solution2](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit31-solution2.png)

Since our file **key.txt** is ignored due to `.gitignore`, we can bypass this by using the flag `-f`.

![bandit31-solution3](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit31-solution3.png)

![bandit31-solution4](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit31-solution4.png)

>**3O9RfhqyAlVBEZpVb6LYStshZoqoSx5K**

## Level 32 &rarr; Level 33

Level Goal

>After all this git stuff, it’s time for another escape. Good luck!

When log in to this level, we're immediately dropped into something called the **Uppercase Shell**, which converts everything we type into **UPPERCASE** letters.

![bandit32-uppershell](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit32-uppercase-shell.png)

So, how to bypass this?

The trick here lies in how this custom shell is built. From the behavior, we can guess that **it's just a wrapper** that takes your input, converts it to uppercase, and then passes it to the system using something like:

```c
system(command);
```

In UNIX-like systems, `system()` typically runs command using `sh -c <command>`. So for example, if we typed `cat`, the shell would actually try to run something like:

```shell
sh -c CAT
```

However, because `CAT` is in uppercase and there's no such binary called `CAT`, the command fails. That’s why basic commands like `sh`, `man`, `ls`,... won't work. They all get converted to uppercase.

We can bypass this by using `$0` to open the `/bin/sh` shell.

![bandit32-solution](public/image/overthewire-bandit/bandit32-solution.png)

But how does `$0` help?

`$0` refers to the script or program being executed. So when **the Uppercase Shell** runs command internally via `sh`, we're **already inside a sh process**. 

>The **Uppercase Shell** basically a `sh` shell, but have the feature of converting input into **UPPERCASE**.

Now typing `$0` will not be uppercased, it stays as `$0`. When the shell evaluates `$0`, it becomes:

```shell
sh -c sh
```

Which effectively just spawns the shell `/bin/sh`.
